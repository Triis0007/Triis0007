### Heya! ðŸ‘‹
Hello there! Welcome to my GitHub profile! How are you doing?

My name is Tris, and I'm a passionate 17-year-old Brazilian transgirl based in the city of SÃ£o Paulo.

#### Some fun tidbits about me:
- ðŸŒ± I'm still in the process of mastering programming, so you might stumble upon some code that's a work in progress in my projects! But hey, we all gotta start somewhere, right?
- âš¡ Fun fact: SÃ£o Paulo, Brazil, is my hometown and the place where my heart resides!
- ðŸ“• Currently, I'm engaged in an exciting project at Denky!, crafting a bot for Discord!

Feel free to explore my projects and don't hesitate to reach out if you'd like to collaborate or just chat about all things tech and beyond! ðŸš€
I'm still learning, so please, don't judge me too harshly!
